# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains all GitHub Actions workflows for the DotCA project. These workflows manage the complete CI/CD pipeline from code changes to production deployment, including testing, building, deployment, and monitoring.

## 🏗️ Workflow Architecture

The workflows are designed with a **staged deployment pipeline** that follows this flow:

```
Code Changes → Build → QA → Staging → Image Promotion → Production
                ↓
            Notifications & Monitoring
```

## 📋 Core Workflows

### 🔨 Build & CI Workflows

#### `docker-build.yml`
**Purpose**: Builds and pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`/`staging` branches, PRs to `main`
- **Outputs**: Tagged Docker images in GHCR
- **Key Features**:
  - Smart path filtering (only builds when code changes)
  - Multi-architecture builds
  - Automatic tagging based on branch/commit
  - Security scanning with Trivy

#### `qa-deploy.yml`
**Purpose**: QA environment pipeline for testing and validation
- **Triggers**: Push to `qa` branch
- **Features**:
  - Runs comprehensive test suite
  - Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
  - Unit and integration tests
  - Test coverage reporting

### 🚀 Deployment Workflows

  - Security checks
  - Automated rollback on failure

#### `image-promotion.yml`
**Purpose**: Promotes staging images to production with manual approval
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch only
- **Security**: Requires manual approval via GitHub environments
- **Key Features**:
  - Image validation and integrity checks
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Manual approval gate for production
  - Automatic production deployment trigger
  - Comprehensive audit logging

### 🔄 Management Workflows

#### `rollback.yml`
**Purpose**: Emergency rollback to previous production version
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch only
- **Key Features**:
  - Rollback to any tagged version
  - Safety confirmations required
  - Automatic health verification
  - Incident documentation
  - Team notifications

#### `environment-destroy.yml`
**Purpose**: Safely destroy staging or production environments
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch with confirmation
- **Safety**: Requires typed confirmation to prevent accidents
- **Features**:
  - Terraform state cleanup
  - Resource verification
  - Cost optimization

#### `qa-destroy.yml`
**Purpose**: Clean up QA environment resources
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch
- **Purpose**: Resource cleanup and cost management

### 📊 Monitoring & Coordination

#### `deployment-notifications.yml`
**Purpose**: Centralized notification system for all deployments
- **Type**: Reusable workflow (called by others)
- **Channels**: GitHub, Slack, Teams, Email
- **Events**: Deployment start/success/failure, promotions, rollbacks

#### `production-verification.yml`
**Purpose**: Standalone production health verification
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch, scheduled (optional)
- **Checks**: Health, performance, security verification
- **Use Cases**: Post-deployment verification, routine health checks

#### `workflow-coordinator.yml`
**Purpose**: Validates workflow dependencies and sequencing
- **Features**: 
  - Dependency validation
  - Workflow readiness checks
  - Sequence recommendations

#### `deployment-status-dashboard.yml`
**Purpose**: Generates deployment status dashboards and reports
- **Features**: Visual status tracking, historical reports

#### `image-history-tracking.yml`
**Purpose**: Tracks and maintains image promotion history
- **Features**: Audit trail, version tracking, compliance reporting

#### `dependency-check.yml`
**Purpose**: Security vulnerability scanning for dependencies
- **Features**: CVE scanning, security reporting

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Required Secrets
- `DO_TOKEN`: DigitalOcean API token
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: SSH key for server access
- `SSH_KEY_FINGERPRINT`: SSH key fingerprint
- `SPACES_ACCESS_ID`/`SPACES_SECRET_KEY`: DigitalOcean Spaces
- `BREVO_API_KEY`: Email service
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Payment processing
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_GA_ID`: Google Analytics

### GitHub Environments
- **production-promotion**: Requires manual approval for image promotion
- Environment protection rules enforce manual reviews for production changes

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For Development
1. **Feature Development**: Work on feature branches, create PRs to `main`
2. **QA Testing**: Merge to `qa` branch to trigger QA pipeline
3. **Staging Testing**: Merge to `staging` branch for staging deployment

### For Production Deployment
1. **Image Promotion**: Manually trigger `image-promotion.yml` with staging image tag
2. **Manual Approval**: Approve promotion in GitHub environment protection
3. **Automatic Deployment**: Production deployment triggers automatically after promotion
4. **Verification**: Monitor deployment health and run additional verification if needed

### For Emergency Situations
1. **Rollback**: Use `rollback.yml` with specific rollback target
2. **Environment Issues**: Use `environment-destroy.yml` if infrastructure needs recreation
3. **Health Checks**: Use `production-verification.yml` for standalone health verification

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Environments
1. Create new deployment workflow (copy from `stg-deploy.yml`)
2. Update Terraform configuration for new environment
3. Add notification channels to `deployment-notifications.yml`
4. Update `workflow-coordinator.yml` dependencies

### Modifying Deployment Flow
1. Update workflow dependencies in respective files
2. Modify notification events in `deployment-notifications.yml`
3. Update image promotion workflow if needed
4. Test changes in staging environment first

## 📈 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission Errors**: Check secrets and GitHub environment settings
- **Deployment Failures**: Review logs in failed workflow runs
- **Image Issues**: Verify images exist in GHCR before promotion
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Check DigitalOcean resources and Terraform state

### Best Practices
- Always test changes in staging before production
- Use manual approval for production changes
- Monitor deployment notifications
- Keep secrets up to date
- Regularly verify production health
