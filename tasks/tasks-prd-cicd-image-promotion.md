- `ansible/templates/logrotate.conf.j2` - Log rotation configuration template
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GHCR.md` - Documentation that needs updating to reflect the new promotion workflow
- `docs/cicd-architecture-comparison.md` - System architecture comparison document showing current vs. new pipeline flow
- `docs/image-promotion-workflow.md` - Detailed image promotion workflow diagrams and process flows
- `docs/image-tagging-strategy.md` - Image tagging strategy and registry organization documentation
- `docs/rollback-strategy-retention-policy.md` - Rollback strategy and image retention policy documentation

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
