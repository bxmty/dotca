# Product Requirements Document: CI/CD Pipeline Image Promotion

## Introduction/Overview

Currently, the CI/CD pipeline rebuilds Docker images for both staging and production environments, leading to longer deployment times and potential inconsistencies between environments. This feature will update the pipeline to promote the tested staging image directly to production instead of rebuilding, creating a more reliable and efficient deployment process.

**Goal:** Implement image promotion in the CI/CD pipeline to eliminate production image rebuilding and ensure production uses the exact same tested image as staging.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Production Image Rebuilding:** Remove the step of building Docker images in production to reduce deployment time and resource usage
2. **Ensure Image Consistency:** Guarantee that production uses the exact same image that was tested in staging
3. **Simplify Pipeline:** Streamline the deployment process by reusing existing, tested images
4. **Improve Reliability:** Reduce deployment failures caused by production build issues
5. **Enable Frequent Deployments:** Support rapid, reliable deployments through image promotion

## User Stories

1. **As a DevOps engineer, I want to promote a tested staging image to production** so that we have a simple and reliable pipeline.

2. **As a DevOps engineer, I want to promote a tested staging image to production** so that I can ensure production has the latest updates.

3. **As a developer, I want confidence that production uses the exact same image as staging** so that I can trust the deployment process and avoid environment-specific issues.

4. **As a DevOps engineer, I want to rollback quickly if needed** so that I can maintain system stability during deployments.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Image Promotion Process:** The system must copy the successfully tested staging image from the staging registry to the production registry with appropriate tagging.

2. **Production Deployment Update:** The system must update production deployment manifests to use the promoted image instead of triggering a new build.

3. **Rollback Capability:** The system must support quick rollback to previous production images when issues are detected.

4. **Pipeline Integration:** The system must integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflows to trigger image promotion after successful staging deployment and testing.

5. **Registry Management:** The system must handle image copying between GitHub Container Registry locations or tags for staging and production.

6. **Deployment Verification:** The system must verify that the promoted image is successfully deployed to production before marking the pipeline as complete.

7. **Error Handling:** The system must provide clear error messages and rollback options if image promotion or deployment fails.

8. **Audit Trail:** The system must maintain a record of which images were promoted, when, and by which pipeline run.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Staging Process Changes:** The existing staging deployment and testing process will remain unchanged.
2. **New Testing Frameworks:** No new testing tools or frameworks will be introduced as part of this feature.
3. **Multi-Environment Support:** This feature focuses only on staging-to-production promotion, not additional environments.
4. **Advanced Image Security Scanning:** While basic image integrity is maintained, advanced security scanning is not included.

## Design Considerations

- **GitHub Actions Integration:** Leverage existing GitHub Actions workflows and secrets for registry authentication
- **Ansible Playbook Updates:** Modify existing Ansible playbooks to use promoted images instead of building new ones
- **Image Tagging Strategy:** Implement clear tagging conventions to distinguish staging and production images
- **Rollback Strategy:** Maintain a history of production images for quick rollback capability

## Technical Considerations

- **Registry Authentication:** Ensure proper authentication for both staging and production registry access
- **Image Size Impact:** Consider the storage and bandwidth implications of copying images between registries
- **Pipeline Dependencies:** Update pipeline dependencies to ensure image promotion happens after successful staging deployment
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Integrate with current Ansible playbooks, GitHub Actions, and container registry setup

## Success Metrics

1. **Deployment Time Reduction:** Reduce production deployment time by eliminating build step (target: 50% reduction)
2. **Pipeline Reliability:** Achieve 95% success rate for production deployments using promoted images
3. **Rollback Speed:** Enable production rollback within 5 minutes of issue detection
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Reduce production environment resource usage during deployments
5. **Developer Confidence:** Increase deployment frequency without compromising stability

## Open Questions

1. **Image Tagging Convention:** What specific tagging strategy should be used to distinguish staging and production images?
2. **Rollback Depth:** How many previous production images should be maintained for rollback purposes?
3. **Promotion Approval:** Should image promotion require manual approval, or can it be fully automated?
4. **Image Cleanup:** What is the retention policy for old staging and production images?
5. **Monitoring Integration:** How should the new promotion process integrate with existing monitoring and alerting systems?

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority:**
- Image promotion mechanism
- Production deployment updates
- Basic rollback functionality

**Medium Priority:**
- Enhanced error handling
- Audit trail implementation
- Performance optimization

**Low Priority:**
- Advanced monitoring integration
- Automated cleanup processes
- Enhanced rollback strategies
