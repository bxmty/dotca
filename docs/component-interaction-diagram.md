## Integration Points

### External Systems

| System | Integration Method | Purpose | Data Exchanged |
|---------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| **GitHub** | Webhooks, API | Source control, CI/CD | Code changes, workflow status |
| **GHCR** | Docker API | Image storage | Image push/pull, metadata |
| **DigitalOcean** | API, SSH | Infrastructure | Droplet management, deployment |
| **Slack** | Webhooks | Notifications | Deployment status, alerts |

### Internal Dependencies

| Component | Depends On | Purpose | Critical Path |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Image Promotion** | Staging Success | Trigger promotion | Yes |
| **Production Deploy** | Image Promotion | Use promoted image | Yes |
| **Rollback System** | Health Monitoring | Detect failures | Yes |
| **Cleanup Workflow** | Storage Monitoring | Manage retention | No |

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Failure Scenarios

```mermaid

    A[Component Failure] --> B{Recovery Strategy}
    
    B -->|Retry| C[Automatic Retry]
    B -->|Rollback| D[Rollback to Previous]

    G -->|No| D
    
    D --> I{Rollback Success?}

    I -->|No| F
    
    style A fill:#ff9999
    style J fill:#ccffcc
    style F fill:#ffcc99
```

### Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Automatic Retry**: Transient failures with exponential backoff
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce functionality instead of complete failure
4. **Manual Override**: Human intervention for complex failures

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Expectations

| Operation | Expected Time | Timeout | Recovery Time |
|-----------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Image Build | 5-8 minutes | 15 minutes | 2-3 minutes |
| Image Promotion | 2-3 minutes | 10 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| Production Deploy | 3-5 minutes | 10 minutes | 2-3 minutes |
| Rollback | 2-4 minutes | 8 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| Health Check | 30 seconds | 2 minutes | Immediate |

### Throughput Considerations

- **Concurrent Deployments**: Maximum 2 simultaneous deployments
- **Image Promotion Rate**: Maximum 1 promotion per 5 minutes
- **Rollback Frequency**: Maximum 3 rollbacks per hour
- **Cleanup Operations**: Maximum 1 cleanup per hour

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

| Component | Access Level | Authentication | Authorization |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Repository | GitHub Token | Workflow permissions |
| **GHCR Registry** | Package | Personal Access Token | Package permissions |
| **Infrastructure** | Server | SSH Keys | User/role-based |
| **Monitoring** | Read-only | API Keys | Metric access |

### Data Protection

- **Image Signing**: Verify image integrity before promotion
- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Secure communication between components
- **Audit Logging**: Track all promotion and rollback actions

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics

```yaml
critical_metrics:
  deployment_success_rate: "> 95%"
  rollback_frequency: "< 5 per day"
  image_promotion_time: "< 5 minutes"
  production_uptime: "> 99.9%"
  storage_usage: "< 80%"

alerting_rules:
  - name: "High Rollback Rate"
    condition: "rollback_frequency > 5 per day"
    severity: "warning"
  
  - name: "Promotion Failure"
    condition: "deployment_success_rate < 90%"
    severity: "critical"
  
  - name: "Storage Critical"
    condition: "storage_usage > 90%"
    severity: "critical"
```

### Logging Strategy

- **Structured Logging**: JSON format for machine parsing
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Log Retention**: 30 days for operational logs, 1 year for audit logs
- **Centralized Collection**: Aggregate logs from all components
